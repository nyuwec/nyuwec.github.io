As hobby photographer I always looking for places my photos can fit into. I started with my own handmade websites, but soon I realized it takes too much time for me to create some fancy site my photos will pop out. And as a young web developer I tried out too many fancy techy eyecandies which hide the photos I wanted to pop out.

##Fotozz.hu
First I joined a Hungarian photography website called [Fotozz.hu](http://fotozz.hu). The focus of that site was back then to bring together photographers and "force" them to give feedback to each other's work. For every feedback the site gave points, to upload a photo I had to use X points. So it was an interesting motivator to spend some time with someone else's photo and give them some feedback. After a while a lot of people started to become a photo critique and I became un-motivated to post any photo or give any feedback as I did receive only a couple useful ones. To sum this experience, I was not able to learn too much being there and getting feedbacks from other non-educated, most of the time rookie/hobby photographers. I felt like being in the kindergarten without a teacher... it was fun at the beginning, but it became boring and frustrating.

##Facebook
As most of us I started posting some of my photos to Facebook when I joined. But there I uploaded low quality, random photos besides the project-like albums. That was a totally different thing, it seemed like finally I can upload as many photos as I like, share it with friends and get some feedback from them. But as you might have guessed I got some likes and some "very cool pics", "wow amazing", etc... comments and after a couple of rounds I felt that this platform does not help me to get some feedback about my photos, so I dropped the album and photo posts and went with the crowd into the total nonsense what we know Facebook is all about.
