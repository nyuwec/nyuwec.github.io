As hobby photographer I always looking for places my photos can fit into. I started with my own handmade websites, but soon I realized it takes too much time for me to create some fancy site my photos will pop out. And as a young web developer I tried out too many fancy techy eyecandies which hide the photos I wanted to pop out.

## Fotozz.hu
First I joined a Hungarian photography website called [Fotozz.hu](http://fotozz.hu). The focus of that site was back then to bring together photographers and "force" them to give feedback to each other's work. For every feedback the site gave points, to upload a photo I had to use X points. So it was an interesting motivator to spend some time with someone else's photo and give them some feedback. After a while a lot of people started to become a photo critique and I became un-motivated to post any photo or give any feedback as I did receive only a couple useful ones. To sum this experience, I was not able to learn too much being there and getting feedbacks from other non-educated, most of the time rookie/hobby photographers. I felt like being in the kindergarten without a teacher... it was fun at the beginning, but it became boring and frustrating.

## Facebook
As most of us I started posting some of my photos to Facebook when I joined. But there I uploaded low quality, random photos besides the project-like albums. That was a totally different thing, it seemed like finally I can upload as many photos as I like, share it with friends and get some feedback from them. But as you might have guessed I got some likes and some "very cool pics", "wow amazing", etc... comments and after a couple of rounds I felt that this platform does not help me to get some feedback about my photos, so I dropped the album and photo posts and went with the crowd into the total nonsense what we know Facebook is all about.

## Flickr
I joined Flickr quite late, I think they were already over the top back then. I think their original concept was closer to Instagram than Google Photos (or Picasa) they transformed into. Also they had a good-enough search engine, so photo discovery became a reality for me. I used Flickr to store my photos in the cloud (when they announced the 1TB storage for free) and to have my fine selection photos in albums. Despite the rusty admin pages and not-so userfriendly (compared to Google Photos) UI I spent huge amount of time uploading and sorting my photos there. I have an account there, but it is empty: https://www.flickr.com/people/nyuwec/ 
I left Flickr for two reasons: it was hard to use it as a photo library and I was not able to put together my "professional" portfolio.

## Meanwhile
I spent a lot of time during these years to find my photo storage and library management solution, I used Canon's ImageBrowserEx, then converting everything into Apple's iPhoto, then into Aperture, then to Photos, then I tried Lightroom and I went back to Photos. I played with the idea to manage everything with Google Photos, but I could not find it "pro" enough, it is more like a good backup and sharing platform rather than a versatile photo library for my needs.
