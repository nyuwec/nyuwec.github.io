In 2018 I attended a photography class organized by [MOME](http://open.mome.hu).
My goal was to get closer to how photography as a form of art works.

I consider myself a hobby photographer, I take photos mostly for my pure joy.
I have not held any professional or amateur exhibition before, but as the closing ceremony of this course I showed my exam photo series to a small audience along with my fellow classmates of 12 people.

At least that was the plan, but unfortunately the exhibition lasted only a couple of hours. So my intent of inviting friends to check my photos failed miserably. I was angry, I was pissed off short sighted the organizers were. All of us were angry back then.

Two ideas came to light that night. The first is that I can create a virtual exhibition to show all the photos from all the classmates. So at least on the web we can can have our corner we can invite our friends to check our work.

Back to the photos; as I want to introduce them first. The title of the task we had to accomplish was: "Dream, Ecstasy, Vision". The real goal was to find something that motivates us and gives the photos some direction or cohesion. Under this umbrella we had to form our message or theme we wanted to formulate. So as you will see we all chose different topics as our "thesis".

Some technical details: I chose to use [PotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com) to handle the image show and all the interactions. I created the "design" from scratch. My goal was to create a very minimalistic site and put the spotlight to the individual galleries, as they are the main attraction. My secondary goal was to have a decent mobile viewing experience, similar what you can get on your mobile OS \*photos app.

And now, here is the link to the [Foto2.0 gallery](http://koles.hu/foto2.0/) page. I hope you'll enjoy the photos.
