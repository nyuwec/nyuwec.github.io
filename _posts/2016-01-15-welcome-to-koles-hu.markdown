Let's start it over again, this time in English. For the sake of practicing the language
and to make it easier to type text without any funky Hungarian letters.

### Why new?

My old webspace died and I had not received any notification about that event.
It means two things:

- It was not so popular.
- I paid no attention to it.

I have a database backup of the old site from 12/5/15, which means that all the text is saved.

### What's next?

This is a fresh start, expect something different. I still don't know what it would be.
(Although if I'll have time I would convert the backup to this new format.)

### What kind of engine and host are you using?

Hahh, good question!

It's running on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for the transformation.
No database, no fancy blog-engine with PHP (yuck!) code to maintain.
No FTP! I mean there is no fucking FTP is used here.

*Holy crap, it's 2016!*

I'll write a small post about the technical background... or you can figure it by yourself [here](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/).
