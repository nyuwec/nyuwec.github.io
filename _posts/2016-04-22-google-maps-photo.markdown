Today I received an email from Google Maps.
They gave me one point(!) because my only photo there reached more than 1000 views.

Now it has [2947 views exactly](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110617674437473699686/photos/@59.3689348,24.1344537,15z/data=!4m3!8m2!3m1!1e1).

Not any of my photos reached that popularity, thanks Google Maps.

Such an interesting turn of events.
